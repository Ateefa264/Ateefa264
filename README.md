# Ateefa Hafeez

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Ateefa Hafeez, a passionate developer with a strong interest in web and Android app development.

Currently, I’m in my 5th semester at FAST (NUCES) Lahore, and I’m expanding my skills in Kotlin, C++, Python, C, SQL, Assembly, and learning JavaScript. I’m actively working on various projects involving Android apps and websites, while also diving into backend development with Node.js to create more efficient and scalable applications.
